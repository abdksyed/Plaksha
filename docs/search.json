    "text": "05 Maths Assignment 12th September\nQuestion1\nConsider the matrix\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2\\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\nWhat does it remind you of?\nWhat does it denote?\nWhere and why do we use a matrix?\nCan you enlist a few applications of matrices?\n\nThe above matrix reminds of the system of equations with two equations and two unknowns.\nIt denotes two vectors in the 2D-space (\\(ℝ^2\\)) which can also be interpreted as two equations.\nWe use a matrix as a function, and also to solve for unknows given equations.\nMatrices are functions which transforms vectors from one space to another space.\nMatrices are used to solve equations as they are represented in a simple manner.\nMatrices helps in storing data like images where elements are values of pixel intensity.\nQuestion 2\nDefine a function. What is a surjective, injective and bijective function?\nA function is a mapping from one space to another space, where each element in the left space(Domain) can have one and only mapping to the element in the right space(Co-domain).\nFunction takes an input from Domain and maps it to an element in co-domain.\nThere can be two or more elements in Domain mapping to same element in co-domain, but there can never be an element in Domain mapping multiple elements in co-domain.\nA Valid Function\n\nAn Invalid Function\n\nImage Credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_%28mathematics%29\nSurjective Function\nThe onto function, is where every element in co-domain has atleast one pre-image in the domain.\n\nImage Credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surjective_function\nInjective Function\nThe one-one function, is where there is only one unique mapping to the element in the co-domain, there can be elements in co-domain which are not mapped, but function must map the elements of the domain to unique element in co-domain.\n\nImage Credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function\nBijective Function\nIt is the combination of both the surjection and injection function, where every element in X is mapped to a unique(exactly one) element in Y, and there are no unpaired elements.\n\nImage Credits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection\nQuestion 3\nGiven an example of a function \\(f:ℝ^2 → ℝ^2\\)\nA function which maps from \\(ℝ^2\\) to \\(ℝ^2\\) will be \\((x,y)\\) to \\((y,x)\\), where the function is mirror reflection along the \\(x=y\\) line\nQuestion 4\nGiven an example of a very nice function \\(f:ℝ^2 → ℝ^2\\) * Make extra efforts to make this function really nice. * Explain what is so nice about your function? * Why should one study such functions?\nA really nice function is the softmax function. The excellent property of this function is it can convert any point in \\(ℝ^2\\) to a probability distribution, which is a vector of probabilities and they are relative to the scale of value in the original vector.\n\\(softmax = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\displaystyle\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}\\)\nFor each value in vector, it exponentiates the value, and divide it by the sum of all values being exponentiated, which gives the sum of all values after applying softmax to 1.\nThe important reason to study such functions, is to make use of it for various applications like classification, where a binary classification problem which gives some arbitrary values can be converted to a nice probability looking value.\nQuestion 7\nConsider \\(ℝ^2\\). What are all the properties of this set? \\(ℝ^2\\) is called a space of all vectors, a.k.a a vector space. Lookup for the definition of a vector space.\nThis set contains all the elements of the form \\((x,y)\\) where \\(x,y \\in ℝ\\). Any vector from this space, when added with another vector from the same space gives a resultant vector, which will also be part of the same space(\\(ℝ^2\\)). Hence it is called the space of all vectors of size 2.\nA vector space can be defined if a set of vectors \\(V\\) and two operations \\(*, +\\) which can be defined in any way, and for our purposes we consider the operatins as general addition and multiplication, must follow the following rules.\n\nThere must be an element 0, where \\(x+0=x, x \\in R^2\\)\nThe vector \\(\\alpha x\\) must belong to \\(ℝ^2\\)\nTwo vectors \\(x,y \\in ℝ^2\\) when added \\(x + y\\) must belong to \\(ℝ^2\\)\n\nQuestion 8\nA subset of a vector space which in itself is a vector space is caled a subspace. Given an example of a subspace of \\(ℝ^2\\).\nThe subspaces of \\(ℝ^2\\) are the zero vector \\((0,0)\\). Any line \\(\\alpha(x,y)\\) and the entire \\(ℝ^2\\) itself.\nQuestion 9\nGiven a vector \\((1,7)\\) what does the set \\({α(1,7)|α∈ℝ}\\) represent? Is it a subspace of \\(ℝ^2\\)?\nThe set of all vectors \\(\\alpha(1,7)\\) represent a line in \\(ℝ^2\\), which is a subspace of \\(ℝ^2\\)\nQuestion 10\nIs \\(ℝ^3\\) a vector space?\nYes, \\(ℝ^3\\) is a subspace as it follows all the 10 axioms of the vector space.\nQuestion 11\nConside the two points \\((1,2,3)\\) and \\((4,5,7)∈ℝ^3\\). What does the following set denote: \\({α(1,2,3)+β(4,5,7)|α,β∈ℝ}\\). Is this a subspace?\nThe following set \\({α(1,2,3)+β(4,5,7)|α,β∈ℝ}\\) denotes the plane in \\(ℝ^3\\). Since both the vectors \\((1,2,3)\\) and \\((4,5,7)\\) are indepent of each other.\nYes, the above plane is a subspace of \\(ℝ^3\\)\nQuestion 53\nSolve the following : \\[\nx−2y=15\n\\] \\[\nx+4y=19\n\\]\n\nIsn’t this the same as \\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -2\\\\\n1 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n15\\\\\n19\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nYou are trying to find if there is an element in the domain which maps to \\((15,19)\\).\nWhat exactly is happening here ? (Say all that you can)\n\nYes, \\((1)\\) is just the matrix representation of the system of equations which are needed to be solved.\nYes, by representing the equations in the matrix form, we are trying to find the unknown \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) which maps to \\((15,19)\\)"

    "text": "1. What is scaling? What is a scalar? What is a vector?\nThe act of either extending/stretching or contracting/squishing something is known as scaling, and the amount it is changed, is given by a number, which is known as a scalar, which denotes that it scales something. This scaling can also change the direction.\nA vector is a list of numbers in some space, where the dimension of space is the number of elements in the vector representation. For example, if the vector is represented by a pair of numbers, than it lies in 2D space, where we can show it as an arrow, with it tail always at the origin and head pointing at the co-ordinates by which the vector is being represented, here the pair of numbers.\n\n2. How do you add two vectors? What is its physical significance?\nTo add two vectors, we do component wise addition of both the vectors, and the requirement to add both the vectors is that they must be in same system, like both the vectors must be represented as pair of numbers, or triplets of numbers, or some n-collection of numbers.\n\\(eg: [a,b,c] + [x,y,z] = [a+x, b+y, c+z]\\)\nThe physical significance of adding two vectors, can be understood as, the combined movement of both the vecors.\nHere the first vector is represented as moving along a units on the x-axis, b units parrallel to y-axis, and finally c units alongs the z-axis. When this is added to the second vector, it is the combined movement along each axis, which is a units on x-axis and than moving x units again on the x-axis, similarly first moving b units on y-axis and further moving y units parallel to y-axis and finally moving c units along z-axis and than moving z units along the z-axis.\nThis entire movement is equal to moving a+x units on x-axis, b+y units parallel to y-axis and finally c+z units along the z-axis.\nHence adding two vectors is equal to just adding the vectors corresponding components.\n\n3. How do you mulitply a scalar with a vector? Think of an application.\nWhen we multiply a scalar with a vector, it either expands/strech out the vector by the scalar(‘number’) it is being multiplied or contracts/squished the vector if the scalar is between 0 and 1.\nAlso, if the vector is multiplied by a negative scalar, the vector change it’s direction by 180°, which means the vector now go in opposite direction and also is extends or contracts by the scalar value which is being multiplied.\nIn mathematical terms, scalar multiplication is just multiplying each component of the vector with the scalar value.\n\nThe scalar multiplication can be used to estimate one variable as scalar multiplication of other variable. For example if we have a vector of weights of a person, and if we know the relation between weight and height of a person(where \\(height = \\alpha * weight\\)), than we can represent the height of all persons as the scalar multiplication of the weight vector with \\(\\alpha\\)."

    "text": "Chapter 2\n4. What is \\(\\hat{i}\\) vector and a \\(\\hat{j}\\) vector. Why are they important?\nThe \\(\\hat{i}\\) vector is a unit vector, having the length 1, along the x-axis and similarly \\(\\hat{j}\\) is a unit vector in the y-direction.\nSo, now with this two vectors, we can represent any vector (x,y), by thinking as the x-coordinate of the vector, that scales the \\(\\hat{i}\\), stretching/contracting by a factor of x. And similarly the y-cordinate of the vector as the scalar that scales the \\(\\hat{j}\\) vector by a factor of y.\nAnd the final vector is the resultant of adding those two sclaed vectors. In this sense, the vectors these co-ordinate (x,y) desctibe is the sum of two scaled vectors \\(\\hat{i}\\) and \\(\\hat{j}\\).\n\n5. Why not consider any other basis vectors instead of the standard unit vectors?\nThe standard unit vectors can be used to easily generate any vector in its vector space, where the first co-ordinate of the vector is just the scalar multlication of the first standard basis vector(x-axis), and second co-ordinate is scalar multiplication of second standard basis vector and so on.\nAny vector can be represented by any set of random basis vectors, but the linear combinations in the cartesian system will be difficult to identify, since those random basis vectors are itself having some x and y co-ordinates value, which directly multiplying with scalar doesn’t give the co-ordinates of the new vector.\n6. How can one get any vector from the basis vectors? What is the intuition?\nSince, the basis vectors are linearly independent and the linear combinations of the basis vectors span the entire the space, we can generate any vector."

Generalize this idea!\nAll the possible linear combinations of two points in \\(ℝ^3\\) is the linear span which is the subspace of \\(ℝ^3\\).\nGeneralizing it, for \\(ℝ^n\\), we have to prove the linear combinations of \\((n-1)\\) points in this \\(ℝ^n\\) is the subspace of \\(ℝ^n\\)\n\\(S = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3, ...., u_{n-1}\\}\\)\n\\(L(S) =\\) is all the possible linear combinations of S, which is known as Linear Span of S\nNow, we have to prove that \\(L(S)\\) is a subspace of \\(ℝ^n\\).\n\\[\nx = \\alpha_1 u_1 + \\alpha_2 u_2 + \\alpha_3 u_3 + ... + \\alpha_{n-1} u_{n-1}\n\\]\n\\[\ny = \\beta_1 u_1 + \\beta_2 u_2 + \\beta_3 u_3 + ... + \\beta_{n-1} u_{n-1}\n\\]\n\\[\nx,y \\in L(S)\n\\]\nNow, to prove that \\(L(S)\\) is a subspace of \\(ℝ^n\\), we have to prove two following conditions:\n\\[\nx+y = z \\in L(S)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lambda x \\in L(S)\n\\]\nProof:\n\\[\nx + y = (\\alpha_1 u_1 + \\beta_1 u_1) + (\\alpha_2 u_2 + \\beta_2 u_2) + ... + (\\alpha_{n-1} u_{n-1} + \\beta_{n-1} u_{n-1})\n\\]\n\\[\nx + y = (\\alpha_1 + \\beta_1)u_1 + (\\alpha_1 + \\beta_1)u_2 + ... + (\\alpha_{n-1} + \\beta_{n-1})u_{n-1}\n\\] Since, \\(L(S)\\) contains all possible combinations, the above \\(x+y \\in L(S)\\)\n\\[\n\\lambda x = \\lambda \\alpha_1 u_1 + \\lambda \\alpha_2 u_2 + ... + \\lambda \\alpha_{n-1} u_{n-1}\n\\] Again, since \\(L(S)\\) contains all possible combinations, the above \\(\\lambda x \\in L(S)\\)\nQuestion 17\nThe set \\({αu+βv|α,β∈ℝ}\\) is called the linear combination of vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). We can generalize this to \\(k\\) vectors. Observe what this set is all about?\nThe entire set when generalized to \\(k\\) vectors, is the linear span of \\(k\\) vectors, which is the subspace.\nQuestion 18\nWe say that a vector \\(w\\) is manufactured by \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) if \\(w∈{αu+βv|α,β∈ℝ}\\).\nYes, when we do \\(w∈{αu+βv|α,β∈ℝ}\\), we get all possible vectors in \\(ℝ^2\\), so we can manufacture any \\(w\\) by the linear combinations of \\(u\\) and \\(v\\)\nQuestion 19\nShow that \\((1,2,3)\\) and \\((4,5,6)\\) can manufacture \\((7,8,9)\\). Also \\((4,5,6)\\) and \\((7,8,9)\\) can manufacture \\((1,2,3)\\).
