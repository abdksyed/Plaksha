When this is added to the second vector, it is the combined movement along each axis, which is `a` units on `x-axis` and than moving `x` units again on the `x-axis`, similarly first moving `b` units on `y-axis` and further moving `y` units parallel to `y-axis` and finally moving `c` units along `z-axis` and than moving `z` units along the `z-axis`.\n",
